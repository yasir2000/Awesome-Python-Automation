### Explanation of Design Choices

1. **FileHandler Interface**: Defines a contract for file processing.

2. **CSVtoExcelConverter Class**: Implements the file handling logic specifically for converting CSV to Excel, following SRP.

3. **FileProcessorFactory**: Uses the Factory pattern to create different types of file handlers, adhering to OCP and DIP.

4. **main Function**: Handles the application flow and configuration loading. It uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables, making the application configurable without changing the code.
