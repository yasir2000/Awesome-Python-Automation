The refactored code will consist of several modules, each adhering to one or more of the principles and patterns you specified.

### Directory Structure
```

```

### Environment Configuration (`.env`)
```
# Camera settings
CAMERA_WIDTH=640
CAMERA_HEIGHT=480

# Frame settings
FRAME_REDUCTION=100
SMOOTHENING=7

# Volume settings
VOLUME_DB=-65.25
VOLUME_PERCENT_SCALE=50
```


### Key Changes Made
1. **SOLID Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class (e.g., `HandDetector`, `VolumeControl`, `VideoCapture`) has a single responsibility.
   - **Open-Closed Principle**: The code is structured to allow for extensions (e.g., adding more detectors).
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: The code does not breach substitutability in its dependencies.
   - **Dependency Injection**: The `AudioController` can be passed or extended without altering existing code.

2. **GoF Design Patterns**:
   - **Facade**: The `AudioController` serves as a facade for audio operations.
   - **Builder**: Not explicitly needed given the current complexity but provides a pathway for future expansions.
   - **Strategy**: The `VolumeControl` and `AudioController` can allow different strategies to adjust audio levels.

3. **Environment Variables**: Configuration values are loaded using `dotenv` from a `.env` file, making the application configurable.
