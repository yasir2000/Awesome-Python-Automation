### Environment Variables File (.env)

```dotenv
SOURCE_FILE=source.json
TARGET_FILE=output.yaml
```

### Explanation of Refactoring

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility:
   - `JsonToYamlConverter`: Converts JSON data to YAML format.
   - `FileHandler`: Manages file reading and writing operations.
   - `JsonYamlApp`: Coordinates the application flow.

2. **Open-Closed Principle**: The `JsonToYamlConverter` can be extended to include more conversion types (e.g., XML) without modifying existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: The `Command` interface serves as a contract that can be extended, although not explicitly used here; itâ€™s designed to show that any command-related actions can be implemented through various classes following the same interface.

4. **Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection**: The `JsonYamlApp` injects the dependencies (`FileHandler` and `JsonToYamlConverter`), allowing for loose coupling among components.

5. **GoF Design Patterns**: 
   - **Facade Pattern**: `FileHandler` provides a simplified interface for file operations.
   - **Strategy Pattern**: The converter utilizes a strategy for converting JSON into YAML.

### Conclusion

This refactored implementation uses SOLID principles and GoF design patterns effectively while ensuring maintainability and scalability. The related environment variables allow for easy configuration and flexibility across different execution contexts.
