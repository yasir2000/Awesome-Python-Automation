### Explanation of the Design Choices

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility. `IpLocator` handles the API call, `GeolocationService` processes the response, and `GeolocationCommand` encapsulates the command logic.

2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification. New locator strategies can be added without changing existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: `IpLocator` implements `LocatorInterface`, allowing for substitutability.

4. **Inversion of Control**: The high-level `GeolocationService` uses the `LocatorInterface` instead of concrete implementations, promoting decoupling.

5. **Dependency Injection**: `GeolocationService` is initialized with a `LocatorInterface`, which allows for easier testing and flexibility.

### Design Patterns Used
- **Factory Method**: `IpLocator` acts as a factory for creating the locator mechanism.
- **Command**: `GeolocationCommand` encapsulates the request for geolocation.
  
This refactor not only organizes the code better but also makes it easier to maintain and extend in the future. It allows for different locator implementations by simply creating new classes that implement the `LocatorInterface`.
