### Key Changes Explained

1. **SOLID Principles**:
    - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has its specific responsibility; `RateProvider` handles fetching and caching rates, `CurrencyAdapter` helps with conversion, and `CurrencyConverter` orchestrates the user interface.
    - **Open-Close Principle**: The system can be extended by adding new currency providers or conversion strategies without altering existing code.
    - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: If additional currency providers are created, they can be substituted without breaking the conversion logic.
    - **Inversion of Control**: Dependency injection is facilitated through the constructor of `CurrencyConverter`.
    - **Dependency Injection**: `CurrencyAdapter` and `RateProvider` are injected into `CurrencyConverter`, making testing and extension easier.

2. **GoF Design Patterns**:
    - **Singleton**: `RateProvider` ensures there is only one instance managing exchange rates.
    - **Adapter**: `CurrencyAdapter` wraps the conversion logic to maintain smooth interactions with the rate provider.
    - **Facade**: `CurrencyConverter` simplifies the user interface by hiding complex logic behind a single method.

This refactor organizes the code modularly, improves maintainability, testability, and prepares it for future extensions while ensuring high code quality.
