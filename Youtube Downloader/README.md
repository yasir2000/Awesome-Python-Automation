# Youtube Downloader

### This is a simple youtube downloader that uses yt-dlp to download one or multiple videos 

### https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

The package includes Windows FFMPEG executables, which is strongly recommended 
as it allows for the merging of audio and video files into one single file. 
You may need to replace these files with ones that are compatible with your OS.

### FFPMEG: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html 

Simply pip install yt-dlp and run the script!
